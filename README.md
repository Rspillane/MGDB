This project's objective is to build an IMDb clone but for video games. I plan to build the complexity up as I go, however initially i am just trying to get used to react and next JS. I am currently using IGDB's API to get the data for the website. 

## Built With

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - React / NextJS

## Future Updates
Some of the features I want to add in the fute include:
  - Save API data onto my own database to practice more backend tech
  - Log in / Account System
  - Ability to wishlist games
  - Ability to rate games
  - More search and filter options
